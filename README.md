# Arduino barkochba (hungarian version of twenty questions) game

Made for a friend's birthday combined with an arduino nano.

Uses PROGMEM and EEPROM to store more questions. EEPROM is used for user added questions.

Makefile ~~stolen~~ borrowed from [Marlin 3D Printer Firmware](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin)'s [makefile](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/blob/2.1.x/Marlin/Makefile) (use arduino IDE or vscode extension instead if you can)
